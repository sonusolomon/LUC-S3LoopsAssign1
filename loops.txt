In Programming we sometimes need to perform an action more than one time.

Ex: 
    We may want to print "Thank you " for 10 times.

    For this, Its easy to write the program but writing a complex code which performs repetetive tasks would be problamatic if we write each task individually though they perform the same action.

Example: 

int main()
{
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    cout<<"Thank You..!";
    return 0;
}

In Situations like this "Loop" concept Its very Helpful. They make execution of repetetive task simple with less line of code.

Rather than Executing a simgle statement for 10 times by wrinting 10 lines of code, you can actually execute a single statement for 10 times by writing one line code using "Loops" concept.

We mostly use two types of Loops:
a) For:
    It is used to perform repetetive tasks when you know the number of iteration beforehand.

    syntax:
        for (initialization exp; test exp; update exp)
        {
            body of the Loop
            statement we want to execute
        }
    
    Example:
        int main()
        {
            for (int i = 1; i<=5; i++){
                cout<<"Hello World";
            }
            return 0;
        }

b) While:
    It is used when we dont know the number of execution before.

    syntax:
        initialization exp;
        while(test exp)
        {
            statement

            Update exp;
        }

    Example:
        int main()
        {
            int 1 = 1;

            while(i<6){
                cout<<"Thank You";

                i++;
            }
            return 0;
        }
